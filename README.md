# eoinR

My personal, ad-hoc, uncommented, unreliable, but extremely useful collection of R functions.

Some of the functions in this package are simple utilities that I use in most analyses,
like `theme_eoin()`, `sem()`, and `tilt_x_ticks()`, and `column_plot()`.
Others are kind of cool, and sometimes useful, likely `eponymous_list()`.
The rest are junk, that probably doesn't work with current versions of R,
or may have never worked correctly.
I haven't sorted through to confirm which is which yet.

Use at your own risk, with absolutely no warranty.
